# OpenPOTD
OpenPOTD is an open source POTD manager discord bot
built to grade short answer and multichoice problems. 
Currently OpenPOTD is in the early stages of 
development. 

## Running OpenPOTD
Register a bot account with Discord and then run the
`init.sh` script. This will create the required config
and data files, then put the token provided by Discord
into the `config/token.txt` file.
