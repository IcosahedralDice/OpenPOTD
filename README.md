# OpenPOTD

OpenPOTD is an open source POTD manager discord bot
built to grade short answer and multichoice problems.
Currently OpenPOTD is in the early stages of
development.  

## Running OpenPOTD

Register a bot account with Discord and then run the
`init.sh` script (for Linux / Mac) or `init.bat` script
for Windows. This will create the required config and
data files, then put the token provided by Discord
into the `config/token.txt` file.
